<h1>Pottery</h1>
<p>
I started doing pottery in 2023 and went to a studio club at Northeastern University. I have always loved making art but I mainly focused on painting and drawing. When I got back home for the summer I bought the cheapest throwing wheel on Amazon and put it in my basement and every night over the summer I would try to throw a decent amount just to practice my skills. I ended up trashing most things I would make but a few made it out of the initial stages. I first started by throwing airdry clay and trimming the pieces, after I had gotten comfortable with creating the object in my head I would try to use fireable clay. I had gotten to make a couple pieces which I was quite proud of. Nowadays anytime I get the chance to throw in the basement ill go for it, the cleanup is hectic though.

<p>This is another piece I threw on the wheel, I aimed to create a large fruitbowl but I ended up destroying it when trimming, it is so easy to mess up your work that you really loved in pottery.</p>
