        <h1>Welcome, I am Souren</h1>
        

        <p>
            Greetings! My name is Souren Prakash and I am currently a senior at Northeastern University. I love spending time with my grandparents and my family. My father has taught me much of having strong conviction and strenght, to try hard and give all I have in my passions. My mother has played a critical part in my life, as she has taught me so much. She is very supportive of my interests and has emphasized thinking critically about all aspects of life. Her encouragement to ask "why" has been a major reason for my perseverance and success in the things I pursue.
        </p>

        <p>Some of my passions include...</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>rock climbing</li>
            <li>working out</li>
